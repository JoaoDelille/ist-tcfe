\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation} 

In the simulation study of an amplifier circuit, the Ngspice software was used, where some modifications were made to the script initially made available in order to obtain the best merit in this work. For this and also as a requirement, the NPN and PNP models were used for the transistors, referring to the Gain stage and the Output stage, respectively.
