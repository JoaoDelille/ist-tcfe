\section{Comparisons}
\label{sec:comparsisons}

In this section, a comparision between the ngspice and octave results is made. Moreover, we delve into the reasons regarding the diffences and similarities observed\\
In these first graphic plots, the voltage gain for both analysis is shown.


In the following tables, the input and ouput inpedances from both analysis are presented.
