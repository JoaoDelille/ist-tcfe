\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion} 
During the course of this Lab, an amplifier with bandpass filter was designed, simulated and theoretically analysed. The theoretical model proved to be faithful in regards to the calculation of the middle frequency, as well to estimate the gain for a band of frequencies; there were deviations, but of small magnitude. It was, however, a insuficient good enough model to calculate the input and output impedances of the circuit, since there were noticeable deviations between it's value and  the simulated one.\\
Due to the limitation imposed by the number and types of resistors and capacitators that could be used, the middle frequency wasn't exactly 1kHz. The middle frequency goal also imposed a limitation, namely on impedances, since the resistors R2 and R1, and the capacitators had to be chosen with this goal in mind Hence, the output impedance couldn't be projected to be as low as possible due to this reason.\\
The final design was able to produce a gain of 2.067604e+01 at a central frequency of 9.030675e+02 Hz.\\
