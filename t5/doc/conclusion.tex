\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion} 
During the course of this Lab, an amplifier with bandpass filter was designed, simulated and theoretically analysed. The theoretical model proved to be faithful to the simulation regarding the calculation of the central frequency, as well the gain estimation for a band of frequencies; there were deviations, but of small magnitude. It was, however, a subpar model for calculating the input and output impedances of the circuit, since there were noticeable deviations between the theoretical values and the simulated ones.\\
Due to the limitations imposed on the number and type of components that could be used, the center frequency wasn't exactly 1kHz. The central frequency goal also imposed a limitation, namely on the impedances. Since the resistors R2 and R1 as well as the capacitators had to be chosen with this goal in mind the output impedance couldn't be lowered.\\
The final design was able to produce a gain of 2.067604e+01 volts at a central frequency of 9.030675e+02 Hz.\\
