% state the learning objective 

%In these laboratory assignement the objective was to study a capacitor with different conditions, since a constant voltage that passed throught it which provocke a open circui, to a sinusoidal voltage and how it progressed with the time.

The circuit in question is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using GNU Octave,  is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is simulated, and the results are compared to the theoretical ones from
aforementioned one. The conclusions of the study are presented in the last section of the document.
