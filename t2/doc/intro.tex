In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using GNU Octave,  is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is simulated, and the results are compared to the theoretical ones from
aforementioned one. The conclusions of the study are presented in the last section of the document.
