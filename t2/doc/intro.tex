% state the learning objective 

\par In these laboratory assignement the objective was to study the reaction of the presented circuit connected to a capacitor under different conditions. From a constant voltage that passes through it, where it works as an open circuit. Up to a sinusoidal voltage, where a detailed study of the node voltages at the capacitor terminals was made as a function of time and frequency. 

\par The circuit in question is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}

\par In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using GNU Octave,  is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is simulated, and the results are compared to the theoretical ones from
aforementioned one. The conclusions of the study are presented in the last section of the document.
