\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this section we conclude the laboaratory assignment , comparing our theoretical and simulation results. 
In this laboratory we were able to study the behaviour of an RC circuit powered by a sinusoidal voltage source $V_S$.
An overview of all the plots, we can see that both Octave and Ngspice are a match, approximatley.
All compared figures are similar, if we ignore some roundings, mostly by Octave, and if we disregard differences in the number of significant algharisms presented by both softwares. 
In the last points, relating to frequency response, the values are a little discrepant in the Octave and Ngspice due to errors made in the simulation of both softwares.
