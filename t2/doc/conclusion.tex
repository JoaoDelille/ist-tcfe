\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this section we conclude the laboaratory assignment , comparing our theoretical and simulation results. 
In this laboratory we were able to study the behaviour of an RC circuit powered by a sinusoidal voltage source $V_S$.
An overview of all the plots, we can see that both Octave and Ngspice are a match, approximatley.
All compared figures are similar, if we ignore some roundings, mostly by Octave, and if we disregard differences in the number of significant algharisms presented by both softwares. 
Not all things taken into account, in this laboratory assignment, went well. But still we can get an aproxximate idea on what we fail and why, but we did not have time to fix it.
