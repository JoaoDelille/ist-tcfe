In these laboratory assignement the objective is to use an AC/DC converter to obtain a DC signal as an output. The DC signal must be a value of 12V from an AC signal with an amplitude of 230V and a frequency of 50Hz. The envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits were chosen by us as shown in Figure...
