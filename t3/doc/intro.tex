\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


In these laboratory assignement the objective is to use an AC/DC converter to obtain a DC signal as an output. The DC signal must be a value of 12V from an AC signal with an amplitude of 230V and a frequency of 50Hz. The envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits were chosen by us as shown in Figure.

This peculiar design was chosen because of the specifications of the prompt for this assignment. The circuit presented makes use of a single small capacitor and a large stack of diodes in series. This does not make it a useful power supply, but it fits within the requirements of the assignment, and produces a steady 12V supply with minimal cost compared to other solutions. This works by stripping a normal envelope detector and limiter circuit of its resistors, and using an oversized limiter as the discharge resistor for the capacitor, behaving as a several megaohm resistor instead of voltage limiter.
