\section{Comparisons}
\label{sec:comparsisons}

In this section we proceed to a comparsison of the results obtained between Ngspice and Octave. Looking at the table down bellow we see a difference in values. This difference can be explained due to the way of functioning of the two softwares that differ from each other. This difference resides in the way the components, Diodes, are treated, that is, Ngspice takes into account a phenomenon called Leakage Currents of the diodes, while we and Octave intend and assume that they have infinite resistance when they are OFF.
