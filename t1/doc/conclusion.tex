\section{Conclusion}
In this laboratory we were able to apply the Kirchhoffs' Laws and Ohm's Law in two structure ways to analyse a circuit with independent and dependent voltage and current sources, as well as linear resistors. In these methods, we obtained a system of equations that we could solve using Octave to aquire either the mesh currents, or the relative voltage at any node.\\
 We also used a simulation software in order to analyse it in a diferent manner: through virtual simulation. In this way, we were able to create a model that substitutes real life circuits but that still let us compare the results of our theoretical analysis. The simulation gave origin to values for the relative voltages and currents in the circuit.The currents obtained through the mesh method were the same as the ones simulated. The voltages, however, were off by a small margin from the ngspice simulated ones.\\
