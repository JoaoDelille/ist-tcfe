\section{Operating Point Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

To realize the computational simulation of the circuit analysis, ngspice was used. A script was created to perform a DC (Operating Point) analysis, and print the results to this table.\\
It is notable that an extra node, node "e" is present in the table, as well as a short circuited voltage source connecting node n\_0 and "e". This procedure doesn't affect the circuit electrically, but is required for the correct funtioning of ngspice. For the correct simulation of the current dependent voltage source $V_{c}$, such dependent current must be read from a shorted voltage source, as ngspice cannot read it from the resistor $R_{6}$ as \ref{fig:circuit} implies.

This table contains the values obtained, labeled accordingly to the image. The potential differentials in each node, labeled $V_{(1 \; through \; 7)}$ are measured in relation to the common ground, node 0.
