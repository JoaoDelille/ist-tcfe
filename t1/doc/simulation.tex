\section{Operating Point Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

To realize the computational simulation of the circuit analysis, ngspice was used. A script was created to perform a DC (Operating Point) analysis, and print the results to this table.\\
It is notable that an extra node, node "e" is present in the table, as well as a short circuited voltage source connecting node n\_0 and "e". This procedure doesn't affect the circuit electrically, but is required for the correct funtioning of ngspice. For the correct simulation of the current dependent voltage source $V_{c}$, the current it depends on must be read from a shorted voltage source, as ngspice cannot read it from the resistor $R_{6}$ as Figure~\ref{fig:circuit} would imply. Since this shorted voltage source is in series with the resistor $R_{6}$, the current is the same in both elements, and thus can be read from either of them.\\

This table contains the values obtained, labeled accordingly to the image. The potential differentials in each node, labeled $V_{(1 \; through \; 7)}$ are measured in relation to the common ground, node 0.
