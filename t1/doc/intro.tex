% state the learning objective 

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing dependent and independent Voltage and Current Sources connected to resistors in series. And to improve our skills on managing all the three sotwares used in this assignement, for future works.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis, developed by GNU Octave, of the circuit is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical ones from
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of the study are presented at the last section of the document.
